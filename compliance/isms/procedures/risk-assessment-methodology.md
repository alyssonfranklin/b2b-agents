## Risk Calculation Matrix

### Formula: **Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact × Asset Value × Threat Level**

### Likelihood Scoring (1-5)
- **5 - Very High (>75%):** Daily/weekly occurrence probability
- **4 - High (50-75%):** Monthly occurrence probability  
- **3 - Medium (25-50%):** Quarterly occurrence probability
- **2 - Low (10-25%):** Annual occurrence probability
- **1 - Very Low (<10%):** Rare occurrence probability

### Impact Scoring (1-5)
- **5 - Critical:** Enterprise deal loss, major client trust damage, regulatory violation
- **4 - High:** Significant business disruption, client complaints, competitive disadvantage
- **3 - Medium:** Moderate operational impact, user experience degradation
- **2 - Low:** Minor inconvenience, limited business impact
- **1 - Negligible:** Minimal or no noticeable impact

### Asset Value Multiplier
- **Critical Assets:** 3x multiplier
- **High Value Assets:** 2x multiplier  
- **Medium Assets:** 1.5x multiplier
- **Supporting Assets:** 1x multiplier

### Threat Level Assessment (1-3)
- **3 - High Threat:** Active threats, known vulnerabilities, high-value target
- **2 - Medium Threat:** Potential threats, moderate exposure
- **1 - Low Threat:** Limited threats, well-protected asset

## Risk Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Asset Identification and Context
1. **Agent Documentation Review**
   - Capabilities and limitations analysis
   - Data handling and processing requirements
   - Client interaction patterns and sensitivity

2. **Threat Landscape Analysis**
   - Current threat intelligence and trends
   - Industry-specific threat considerations
   - Historical incident patterns and lessons learned

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Technical vulnerability identification
   - Process and procedural weaknesses
   - Human factor and training gaps

### Phase 2: Risk Evaluation and Scoring
1. **Likelihood Assessment**
   - Threat capability and motivation analysis
   - Current control effectiveness evaluation
   - Historical incident frequency and patterns

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Business impact assessment (financial, operational, reputational)
   - Client impact evaluation (trust, compliance, operations)
   - Regulatory and legal consequence analysis

3. **Risk Score Calculation**
   - Apply risk formula with all multipliers
   - Document assumptions and rationale
   - Validate scoring with stakeholder review

### Phase 3: Risk Treatment Planning
1. **Risk Treatment Options**
   - **Mitigate:** Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
   - **Transfer:** Insurance, contracts, or third-party risk sharing
   - **Avoid:** Eliminate the risk through design or process changes
   - **Accept:** Document acceptance rationale and monitoring plan

2. **Control Selection and Design**
   - Technical controls (encryption, access controls, monitoring)
   - Administrative controls (policies, procedures, training)
   - Physical controls (infrastructure, environmental)

3. **Implementation Planning**
   - Priority-based implementation timeline
   - Resource allocation and responsibility assignment
   - Success criteria and effectiveness measurement
