# ISO Compliance Framework
*Dual compliance approach for B2B AI agent ecosystem*

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive documentation for our dual ISO compliance strategy, making this the first publicly auditable ISO-compliant AI agent ecosystem.

## Dual Compliance Value Proposition
**Repository Certification:** The B2B agent repository itself is ISO-certified
**Solution Validation:** Every agent-created deliverable is pre-validated for ISO compliance
**Market Position:** ISO-certified agents delivering ISO-compliant solutions

## Standards Implementation
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - Information Security Management Systems
- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** - AI Management Systems
- **ISO/IEC 42005:2025** - AI System Impact Assessment

## Current Compliance Status
- **ISO 27001:** Implementation in progress (Target: Week 8)
- **ISO 42001:** Implementation in progress (Target: Week 10)  
- **ISO 42005:** Implementation in progress (Target: Week 12)
