    - data_classification_applied: true
    - access_controls_documented: true
    - privacy_protection_verified: true
  
  ai_governance_checks:
    - professional_boundaries_stated: true
    - human_oversight_required: true
    - ai_limitations_disclosed: true
  
  impact_assessment_checks:
    - stakeholder_considerations: true

**Processing Time:** 30-60 seconds  
**Coverage:** Deep content analysis and compliance mapping

**Content Analysis Framework:**
- Professional standard compliance verification
- Regulatory requirement mapping and validation
- Risk assessment integration and mitigation verification
- Stakeholder impact analysis and communication requirements

#### Tier 3: Human Expert Review (2-24 hours)
**Trigger:** Critical deliverables, regulatory submissions, or validation failures  
**Processing Time:** 2-24 hours based on complexity  
**Coverage:** Complete compliance validation with expert oversight

**Expert Review Process:**
- Domain expert validation of professional content accuracy

## Automated Validation Engine

### Real-Time Validation API
```python
class ComplianceValidator:
    def __init__(self, agent_type, client_domain, deliverable_type):
        self.agent_type = agent_type
        self.client_domain = client_domain
        self.deliverable_type = deliverable_type
        self.risk_level = self.calculate_risk_level()
    
    def validate_solution(self, content):
        # Tier 1: Automated pre-validation
        if not self.tier1_validation(content):
            return self.rejection_response()
        
        # Risk-based tier escalation
        if self.risk_level >= 3:
            return self.tier2_validation(content)
        else:
            return self.auto_approval(content)
