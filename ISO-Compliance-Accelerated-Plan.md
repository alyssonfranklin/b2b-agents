# ISO Compliance Roadmap - Accelerated 10-12 Week Plan
*AI-assisted approach for rapid ISO 27001, ISO 42001, and ISO 42005 certification*

## Overview
This accelerated roadmap leverages AI assistance (Claude Code) and focused daily sprints to achieve compliance with three critical ISO standards in 10-12 weeks. This approach delivers **DUAL COMPLIANCE VALUE**: making the B2B agent repository itself ISO-certified while ensuring all agent-created solutions are ISO-compliant for clients.

## Dual Value Proposition
**Repository Certification:** "ISO-certified 70+ specialized B2B AI agents"  
**Solution Validation:** "Every deliverable pre-validated for ISO compliance"
**Market Position:** First ISO-certified AI agent ecosystem that delivers ISO-ready solutions
**Competitive Advantage:** Clients get both certified agents AND ISO-compliant deliverables

## Standards Covered
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - Information Security Management Systems
- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** - AI Management Systems  
- **ISO/IEC 42005:2025** - AI System Impact Assessment

## Current Compliance Assessment
- **ISO 27001:** ~25% compliant
- **ISO 42001:** ~30% compliant  
- **ISO 42005:** ~15% compliant

## Success Formula
**3 hours/day + AI assistance + focused sprints = 10-12 week certification**
