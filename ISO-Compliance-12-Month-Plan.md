# ISO Compliance Roadmap - 12 Month Plan
*Traditional enterprise approach for ISO 27001, ISO 42001, and ISO 42005 certification*

## Overview
This comprehensive 12-month roadmap follows traditional enterprise governance practices for achieving compliance with three critical ISO standards for AI and information security management. This approach delivers **DUAL COMPLIANCE VALUE**: making the B2B agent repository itself ISO-certified while ensuring all agent-created solutions are ISO-compliant for clients.

## Dual Value Proposition
**Repository Certification:** "ISO-certified 70+ specialized B2B AI agents"
**Solution Validation:** "Every deliverable pre-validated for ISO compliance"
**Market Position:** First ISO-certified AI agent ecosystem that delivers ISO-ready solutions

## Standards Covered
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** - Information Security Management Systems
- **ISO/IEC 42001:2023** - AI Management Systems  
- **ISO/IEC 42005:2025** - AI System Impact Assessment

## Current Compliance Assessment
- **ISO 27001:** ~25% compliant
